# London Bike Rides Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the London bike rides dataset to uncover trends and patterns in bike usage based on weather conditions, time, and temperature. The data was downloaded using the Kaggle API, cleaned and explored in Python (Jupyter Notebook), and then saved in Excel for visualization in Tableau.

## Key Visualizations:

**Moving Average**: Analyzed trends in bike rides over time, providing insights into usage fluctuations.

**Total Bike Rides**: Visualized the frequency of bike rides, highlighting peak usage periods.

**Heatmap**: Explored the relationship between temperature and wind speed, showing how weather influences ridership.

**Bar Charts**: Displayed the impact of weather conditions and the hour of the day on bike rides.

**Interactive Tooltips**: Added tooltips to enhance the interactivity and provide additional insights directly within the visualizations.

## Tools Used:

**Python**: Data gathering, exploration, and manipulation.

**Tableau**: Creation of interactive dashboards and visualizations.

**Exce**l: Final data organization and preparation for Tableau.

## Key Insights:

Identified peak bike usage hours and the weather conditions that most influence ridership.

Discovered correlations between temperature, wind speed, and bike ride frequency.

Delivered actionable insights through user-friendly and interactive visualizations that support better decision-making.
